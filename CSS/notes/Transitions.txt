Transitions are used to control an element when it is transforming from one state to another state.
it contains
   Transition property
   Transition Duration
   Transition Timing Function
   Transition Delay

Transition property: it contains property names that needs to have transition. 'all' covers all properties
Transition Duration: it defines the time the transition takes (in seconds or milliseconds)
Transition Timing Function: it defines how the transition should go. There are different functions,popular are:
   linear: maintains constant growth
   ease: maintains explosive growth
   ease-in: starts slowly and gains speed
   ease-out: starts fastly and becomes slow
   ease-in-out: starts slowly and becomes fast and ends slowly


Animations: Animations are used to show the transition of element between multiple state
Animations need keyframes to define its each frame. Animations properties are
Animation name , Animation Duration, Animation Timing Function etc..,
