Float :  Float is used to make an element float right or left of next element. Float will remove the element from actual flow.
  float: left/right/none;

when an element is floated, it is removed from the normal document and positioned left or right of the parent element. so the surroundings will just wrap around floated element

clearing the floats : when using float, its necessary to clear the float to prevent elements wrapping around
   clear:left/right/both

Initially, float is used for multi column layout
