Images:
========
    To show the images we use 'img' tag. It contains two attributes 'src' and 'alt'
    src  -- it contains source path of the image
    alt -- it contains alternate title which will print when src value is not working
    we can even adjust size of the image using height and width attributes
    eg: <img src="path" alt="title" >  (or)
        <img src="path" alt="title" />

    'img' is a self closing tag. some elements or tags doesn't need to be closed. it will have only open tags. These are called self closing tags or void elements or unpaired tags

  for local images use relative path,
     single dot -- current folder
     double dot -- previous folder
