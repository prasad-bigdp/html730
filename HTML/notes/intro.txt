HTML (HyperText Markup Language) : it is used to create the structure or skeleton of the web page.

 Whole HTML code will be between HTML open and close tags.
 <html>
 </html>
 open tag+content+close tag is called element.
 Html contains two elements head and body
head represents meta data
body represents actual content of website

sample code:
<html>
    <head>
      <title>My First Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello world
    </body>
</html>
VScode provides some shortcuts called emmets
emmet for basic HTML code is !+enter (or) html:5+enter
HTML is not case sensitive and HTML is not a programming Language
comments:
   comments are used to describe the code and for the readability of code to developers. comments doesn't effect actual code
   In HTML, comments are between <!--  and -->

Every element will have some properties called attributes. These attributes will have values .
eg: <human name="prasad"></human>

<!DOCTYPE html>  <!-- This line represents following document is HTML type  -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- HTML open tag with attribute lang of value "en"-->
<head>   <!-- head opening tag -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8"><!-- it represents our code follows character set of unicode transmission format with 8 bits-->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <!-- it represents our viewport having initial zoom 100% and width based on device width-->
  <title>Document</title> <!-- title represents title of website which comes on tab section-->
</head>  <!-- head closing tag-->
<body>  <!-- body opening tag -->
