ES6 : ECMASCRIPT decides the standards and updates of all scripting languages including Javascript.ES6 version released in 2015 and brought lot of new features to JAvascript such as
arrow functions, template literals, default parameters, rest and spread operators, array and object descturing, ES6 modules,OOP

Array and Object destructuring:
   Array contains lot of elements represented by index , what if we want to separate array elements. ES6 allows us to that.
   // array destructuring
let arr = [5, 6, 7];
let [a, b, c] = arr;
// let x = arr[0]
console.log(a, b, c, arr);
   Objects contains key and values as properties. we can separate them as a copy using object destructuring
   // object destructuring
let obj = {
    name: "shekhar",
    age: 55
}
console.log(obj.name);
let { age } = obj;
// let age = obj.age
console.log(age);

   Rest and Spread operators:
   Rest operator is denoted by three dots and is used to represented rest of the parameters. it is always last value in receiving parameters.
   // rest operator
function sum (a, ...b)
{
    console.log(a,b) //5   [4,3,2,1]
}
sum(5, 4, 3, 2, 1);
let [p, q, ...r] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
spread operator is used to separate or spread the values of array. it is also dentoted by three dots.

 let c = [...[1, 2], ...[3, 4]];
    console.log(c)

OOP: it is a a programming technique called Object Oriented Programming.Here, objects are created by using  a template called 'class'. objects are physical entities that contains properties and methods.
   class a template or blueprint to create objects. it is a collection of objects
