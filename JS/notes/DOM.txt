DOM:
-----
    Every Browser Provides an object to store complete html and css code before presentation called 'document'. it provides a tree like structure to HTML.
    for eg: 
    <html>
       <head>
         <title>dhjdf</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <p>hello</p>
          <h2>Hii</h2>
        </body>
    </html>
    it is treated as tree with html root and head and body as childredn where head have title as children and body have p and h2 as children.

    DOM selection: we can select or access DOM elements using multiple ways such as
       i. getElementsByTagname('tagname') : it is used to select all elements belongs to a particular tag name.

       ii. getElementsByClassName('classname') : it is used to select all elements belongs to a particular class name

       iii. getElementById('idname') :  it is used to select any element with respective ID.

       iv. querySelector('query): it is used to select an element based on query. but it selects only first element

       v. querySelectorAll('query') : it is used to select all elements based on query

  DOM Manipulation: we can manipulate existing DOM elements using following properties
      i. textContent : it is used to get data inside the element
      ii. innerText : it is used to get the data inside the element but it also observes CSS, so if element is not visible , it cannot take value
      iii. innerHTML : it is used to manipulate HTML code into the element
      iv. style : it is used to change the style of an element
      v. value : it is used to manipulate value of input elements
      vi. classList: it is used to add or remove or toggle the class names
