DOM:
-----
    Every Browser Provides an object to store complete html and css code before presentation called 'document'. it provides a tree like structure to HTML.
    for eg: 
    <html>
       <head>
         <title>dhjdf</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <p>hello</p>
          <h2>Hii</h2>
        </body>
    </html>
    it is treated as tree with html root and head and body as childredn where head have title as children and body have p and h2 as children.

    DOM selection: we can select or access DOM elements using multiple ways such as
