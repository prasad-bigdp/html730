Control statements: These statements are used to control the flow of code based on a decision or condition. These are also called Decision Making statements.
   i. if
   ii. switch

i. if : if is used to check whether a condition is true or false, if it is true it follows a set of statements, else it follows another set of statements.
   if(condition){
    //statements
   }
   we can also use if .. else to represent false conditions
   if(condition){
    //statements
   }
   else{
    //statements
   }
   we can also make latter if else, using if else if
   if(condition){
    //statements
   }
   else if(condition){
    //statements
   }..........
   else {
    //statements
   }


ii. switch : swtich is used to connect multiple blocks and need to run only one based on case value
  switch(value){
    case value1 : //statements; break;
    case value2 : //statements; break;
    case value3 : //statements; break;
    case value4 : //statements; break;
    default : //statement;
  }
