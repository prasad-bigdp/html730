Datatypes in JS: Javascript is dynamically typed language. The datatype is decided by type of data the variable holds.when value changes, datatype also changes.
Primarily datatypes are divided as two types
   i. primitive datatypes
   ii. Non Primitive Datatypes

i. Primitive Datatypes: These datatypes are used to represent variables that holds single value.Mostly used Primitive types are
   a. number
   b. string
   c. boolean
   d. null
   e. undefined
ii. Non Primitive Datatypes: These datatypes are used to represent variables that holds collection of values. They are
   a. functions
   b. Arrays
   c. objects

To find the datatype of a variable, we can use an operator called 
"typeof variable_name"

Type conversion: Javascript can convert one datatype into another data type called type conversion or type casting
     --> Implicit Type casting: JS can automatically converts datatypes based on operations called Implicit Type casting
     --> Explicit Type Casting : we can convert datatypes using external operators or keywords called Explicit Type casting

     eg:  console.log(5+'5') //55  -- Implicit
          console.log(5+Number('5')) -- Explicit

Primitive Data Types:
=====================
a. Number: number is used to store any numerical values like intergers, decimal etc.., 
      let a=10.84; // datatype of a is number
    numbers have default functions like
