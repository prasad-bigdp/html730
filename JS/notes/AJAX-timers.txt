To understand AJAX, we need to understand timers and promises.
Timers: Timers are the default methods provided by Browser. There are two methods to provides AJAX timers such as
  i. setTimeout
  ii. setInterval


i. setTimeout : it is used to delay the execution of a function to a particular time(in seconds or milli seconds)
  setTimeout(function,time)
  setTimeout(function ()
{
    console.log("hello world")
}, 1000)

ii. setInterval : it is used to repeat the execution of a function after each interval of time(in milliseconds)
setInterval(function,time)
setInterval(function ()
{
    console.log("hello world")
}, 1000)

we can stop the setTimeout or setInterval using clearTimeOut or clearInterval
