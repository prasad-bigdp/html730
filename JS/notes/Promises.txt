Promises:  Promise is an object which describes an eventual completion of Asynchronous Operation
 Promises results in server request , timers or any operation that takes some time.
 Before Promises, it is handled by callbacks and it creates a probelm callback hell or pyramid of DOOM

//backend
let p = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) 
{
    if (mood = "good")
    {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("take 1 lakh"), 2000) 
    }
    else
    {
        setTimeout(() => reject("I will not give"), 2000) 
    }
})
console.log(p)
//frontend
p
    .then((res) => console.log(res))
    .catch((err) => console.log(err));


sometimes, Promises can combine the values using Promise.all(promises,promises)

one Promise value can lead to another Promise called "Promise chaining"

API : Application Programming Interface
   It is used to connect client to server and used to request the data or post the data to server.

Most used API in web developement is REST API(Representational state Transfer ) which results data in JSON(Javascript object notation) format
we use fetch method provided by Browsers and provide them a link(endpoint) which contains JSON data.

endpoint(url) will have JSON data like
https://dummyjson.com/quotes/random

we can use fetch to get it
fetch(endpoint)

basic syntax for fetch execution
   fetch(endpoint)
     .then((res)=>res.json())
     .then((data)=>console.log(data))
     .catch((err)=>console.log(err))

Async Await : Async await is another way of writing asynchronous code. fetch returns promise which can be resolved/handled by using then and catch but instead we can also use modern simple way, Async - Await
 async function functionName(){
      const res = await fetch(endpoint)
      const data = await res.json()
      console.log(data);
       }
In Promises , error block is available but in async await you should use try catch block  

 async function functionName(){
      try{
        const res = await fetch(endpoint)
      const data = await res.json()
      console.log(data);
      }
      catch(err){
        console.log(err)
      }
       }
